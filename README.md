# resume-frontend

This is a work in progress resume builder. Continue to check back occassionally for future updates and further progression of the code :)

Looking forward to deploying at the completion of this project so users can easily create their own go to resume and make updates and additions to it quick and easily anytime!

Current Features:

Sign in or sign up mode as soon as successfully run a 'bundle install', 'rails db:create', 'rails db:migrate', 'rails db:seed', and 'rails s' from the backend repository listed below!

https://github.com/joshycsm/backend_resume

Once signed in, there is an edit mode that allows the user to create/update different sections that would typically assist in a standard software developer's resume.

Updating resume is currently being prevented unless you sign in as:
username: parker123 , password: parker123

Correcting name spelling when creating accounts coming soon; followed by updating resume functionality for all new users.

Enjoy!
